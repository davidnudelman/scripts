There are different ways to map a printer to a machine

The preffered option f you are on a domain is to use Group Policy preferences

On powershell the command is similar to the below
$prnt = [wmiclass]"Win32_Printer"
$prnt.AddPrinterConnection("\\PrintServer\PrintShare")

For DOS based application or any application that can use LPT ports you can use:
net use LPTx: \\servername\printer /persistent:yes

Running net use and mapping a printer to a LPT port will cause the printer not to show up on printers and devices on a Windows 10 Machine

For Windows 10 make sure you use V4 printer drivers. Earlier versions of Windows do not like v4 drivers.
